# Total_varation
total vatiation minimization\denoise using tensorflow

$\underset{x}{\min} \frac{1}{2} \|x-y\|^2_2 +\lambda\sum_i|x_i-x_{i-1}|$

i have a cancer called LAZY, voiding the study of classic algorithms like [proxTV](https://github.com/albarji/proxTV)
# TODO
very long TODO list
* using tensorflow (lazy me),start from 1 dim sequence, then 2d, then 2d with channels(deal with color)
* using cython,mimic the ProxTV project

# Current State
only a erroneous 1d tf version
